## Plotting your data 
Plotting is a key aspect of data analysis. It is valuable during two distinct phases: data exploration (at the beginning of the analysis cycle); and data presentation (often at the end of the analysis cycle). 

Base R will generate some interesting plots and it's always worth trying the plot() function to see what happens. Another useful function for multidimensional data is pairs() which allows multiple comparisons. 

The majority of this section will focus on using the ggplot2 library authors by Hadley Wickham. There is very good online documentation available <http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/> and a book available on github <https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book>

## Our inspiration
Our inspiration for this session is this graph published by the Economist a few years ago.

## Get the data
The data needs to be downloaded first. It has already been placed on github
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# first the 2011 Corruption Data index
link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brennanpincardiff/LearnR/master/data/CPI2011_Results.xls"
download.file(url=link, destfile="file.xls", mode="wb")
corInd <- read_excel("file.xls")

# extract two columns we want
corInd <- corInd[,1:2]

# second bit of data is 
link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brennanpincardiff/LearnR/master/data/2015_Statistical_Annex_Table_2TrendsHumanDevIndex.xls"
download.file(url=link, destfile="file.xls", mode="wb")
hdi <- read_excel("file.xls",
                  skip = 6, col_names = TRUE)

# column 2 with country names
# column 6 with 2011 data
# extract just these columns
hdi <- cbind(hdi[,2], hdi[,6])
# improve column names for merge
colnames(hdi) <- c("country", "hdi2011")

# now merge the two dataframes to create a new dataframe
# by country name
data <- merge(corInd[,1:2], hdi, by="country")
# interestingly just 161 observations. 
# still it's a good start. 
```

## Here is the data
Using the head() function
```{r, echo=TRUE}
head(data)
```



## Our first graph
Our data is in a data.frame. 
We can plot this data with the plot function
```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(data$cpi11, data$hdi2011)

```

There are many ways to customise the plot using the plot() function but I'm not going to describe them. I'm going to go straight to using ggplot2. 
The key to understanding ggplot is that you assemble the data in stages. 
The first stage is attaching the data and then adding aesthetics (aes).
The tells ggplot what data to use and what parts of the data are to be used in the x dimension and the y dimesions. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data, 
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011))
  
```  

The key thing to note is that we have a graph but no points. ggplot has set the axis and added titles based on the titles of the columns from which the data is taken. 
This is because we haven't told ggplot what kind of graph to prepare. There are many options, of course.

The options are often described as a geometry (geom) and a good example is geom_point

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data, 
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011)) +
  geom_point()
  
```  

The geom_point now adds the points with the default settings. 

Note the is one warning - one row has been ignored. If we look at the data we see that this row is lacking a piece of data.

The documentation <http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/geom_point.html> contains lots information about how geom_point() can be used. 

Here are some examples:
Colouring the points:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data, 
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011)) +
  geom_point(colour = "red")
  
```  

Size and fill points:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data, 
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "blue", fill = "white", size = 3, stroke = 1.25)
  
```  

Usually we create a plot object and then add details to the plot object. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
p <- ggplot(data, 
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011)) +
     geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "blue", fill = "white", size = 3, stroke = 1.25)
  
```  
This doesn't plot anything but creates a list object. 
This can be seen by looking at the environment window in RStudio which should look a bit like this picture:

To see the plot, type the name of the object
```{r, echo=TRUE}
p 
  
```  

## Adding some titles
We can display the object and add some extra details. 
These are just produced in the display. 
In this example we have added a title and we have labelled the x and y axis. 
```{r, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE}
p + ylab("Human Development Index, 2011 (1=best)") +
    xlab("Corruption Perceptions Index, 2011 (10=least corrupt)") +
    ggtitle(paste("Corruption & human development"))
  
``` 

The x and y axis titles look a little large, I think.
By using the theme() function with the argument axis.title, we can customise the text to look the way we want to...
```{r, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE}
p + ylab("Human Development Index, 2011 (1=best)") +
  xlab("Corruption Perceptions Index, 2011 (10=least corrupt)") +
  ggtitle(paste("Corruption & human development")) +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = 8, face = "italic")) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 8, face = "italic"))

``` 

## Making a more interesting plot
We can make more complex graphs by adding more data, for example the continent or the economic region. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# add continents (not same as graphic but more understandable)
# Colour by continent inspired by Gapminder
# Data adapted from http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/notOcto/STAT545A/examples/gapminder/data/gapminderCountryColors.txt
x <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brennanpincardiff/RforBiochemists/master/data/countryColors20151026")
countryColors <- read.csv(text = x)
data <- merge(data, countryColors, by="country")
# lost a few more countries - just 133 now... needs a check at some point
```

A look at data suing the head() function the extra detail.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
head(data)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data, 
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011, 
           colour = continent)) +
     geom_point()
  
```  


## Introducting facet_wrap()
The function facet_wrap() allows us to split the visualisation into different plots. It keeps the scales the same so it allows comparsions but is very useful if there are too many points on the first plot. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data, 
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011, 
           colour = continent)) +
     geom_point() +
     facet_wrap(~continent)
``` 

## Graph with a subset of data...
So after using the facet_wrap(), we decide we want a graph of just the Africa data not all of it. So we can make a subset of the data on the fly. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data[data$continent == "Africa",], # creates a subset of the data
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011, 
           colour = continent)) +
     geom_point()

``` 



## Using a different geometry (geom_line())

So adding a different geometry gives us a different the graph. 
For example the geom_line() 

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning= FALSE}
ggplot(data[data$continent == "Africa",], # creates a subset of the data
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011)) +
     geom_line()
  
```  

Not the most useful line. So instead we add a linear model using the stat_smooth(). 


```{r, echo=TRUE, warning= FALSE}
ggplot(data[data$continent == "Africa",], # creates a subset of the data
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011)) +
     stat_smooth(method = "lm")
```  

This figures just shows the line. The dark grey describes the confidence interval of the line. 
How about we add points to the graph and it will look better. 



```{r, echo=TRUE, warning= FALSE}
ggplot(data[data$continent == "Africa",], # creates a subset of the data
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011)) +
     stat_smooth(method = "lm") +
     geom_point(size = 2)
```  

## Fitting a curve
A curve, rather than a line, better describes the original data. 

To fit the line requires geom_smooth().

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning= FALSE}

ggplot(data, 
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011)) +
     geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "blue", fill = "white", size = 3, stroke = 1.25) +
  geom_smooth(method = "nls", 
              method.args = list(formula = y ~ HDImax * x / (cpi50 + x), 
                                 start = list(HDImax = 1, cpi50 = 0.5)),
              se = F, size = 2, 
              data = data)
  
```

The order is important
```{r, echo=TRUE, warning= FALSE}

ggplot(data, 
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "nls", 
              method.args = list(formula = y ~ HDImax * x / (cpi50 + x), 
                                 start = list(HDImax = 1, cpi50 = 0.5)),
              se = F, size = 2, 
              data = data) +
     geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "blue", fill = "white", size = 3, stroke = 1.25)
  
  
```
Points now on top of the line. 
Because ggplot uses layers as a key element of the grammer of graphics, the order of the code is the order of the layers.

## Controlling the axis. 
We saw earlier how to add titles to their graphs. ggplot also contains various ways to control the axis of the graphs. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning= FALSE}
# create the object first
p <- ggplot(data, 
       aes(x = cpi11,
           y = hdi2011,
           colour = continent)) +
     geom_smooth(method = "nls",  # with the curve
              method.args = list(formula = y ~ HDImax * x / (cpi50 + x), 
                                 start = list(HDImax = 1, cpi50 = 0.5)),
              se = F, size = 1, 
              data = data, 
              colour = "red") +
     geom_point(shape = 21, 
                fill = "white", size = 2, stroke = 1.25) +
     ylab("Human Development Index, 2011 (1=best)") +
     xlab("Corruption Perceptions Index, 2011 (10=least corrupt)") +
     ggtitle(paste("Corruption & human development")) +
     theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = 8, face = "italic")) +
     theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 8, face = "italic"))
  
p  # show the graph  
```

So I would like to change the axis
In the figure the y-axis goes from 0.2 to 1 and the x-axis goes from 1 to 10.
We can use the ylim() and xlim() functions.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning= FALSE}
# use ylim() and xlim() functions to modify the object
p + ylim(0.2, 1) +
    xlim(1,10)
```

This broadens the axis but doesn't give us quite what it shows in the original figure. 

The scale_x_continuous() and scale_y_continuous() gives more options. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning= FALSE}
# modify the object with scale_x_continuous() and xlim() functions
p <- p + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1,10),   # start and end
                     breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)) +   # names
         scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.2, 1.0),
                     breaks = c(0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5,
                                0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1))

p # show the new object
```

This graph has all the necessary numbesr on the axis. 

## Using a theme
ggplot allows the addition of a theme - and there are many available. 
You can also create custom themes. 
There are more themes in the ggthemes package. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning= FALSE}
# exploring themes
p + theme_bw()   # I like the black and white theme
```


```{r, echo=TRUE, warning= FALSE}
# exploring themes 
# Stephen Few theme
p + theme_few()   
```



```{r, echo=TRUE, warning= FALSE}
# exploring themes
# Edward Tufte theme
p +  theme_tufte()   
```



```{r, echo=TRUE, warning= FALSE}
# exploring themes
# economist themes
p + theme_economist()   
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning= FALSE}
# exploring themes
# economist themes
p + theme_economist_white(gray_bg=FALSE)  
```

## Next step is adding some text...
Adding text requires the addition of another geom to the plot:
geom_text().

One way to add text is to select specific countries that you want to label. Then generate a data.frame with this subset only. 

Should be able to subset the dataframe with a vector!!!





```{r, echo=TRUE, warning= FALSE}

p <- p + theme_bw()  # apply our theme

# select the countries we want to display
country_list <- c("Botswana", "Rwanda","Norway", "France",
                  "Argentina", "Sudan", "Myanmar", "Italy")

# make a data frame of the subset
labels <- data[data$country %in% country_list, ]

p + geom_text(data=labels,
              aes(x = cpi11,
                  y = hdi2011,
                  label = country))
```

The colors used reflect the colours and the text is located at the centre of the point. This makes it a little difficult to read. 

So, we can customise the labels a bit...


```{r, echo=TRUE, warning= FALSE}
p + geom_text(data=labels,
              aes(x = cpi11,
                  y = hdi2011,
                  label = country),
              colour = "black",
              size = 3, hjust=1, vjust=-0.5)
```

We could select what points to label by random

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning= FALSE}
p + geom_text(data = data[sample(nrow(data), 8), ], # random selection
              aes(x = cpi11,
                  y = hdi2011,
                  label = country),
              colour = "black",
              size = 3, hjust=1, vjust=-0.5)
```

Every time you run the code, it's different...




Selecting labels by extremes from line (use predict)
Justify labels on one side one way and another side another way...

You can do all of these too.


Final learning point is to force in new data into the same plot...

Then make multiple plots and layout together?
